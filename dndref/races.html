                <h1>Races</h1>
                <p>Characters in D&D, in addition to a background and a class, have a race. This is an inherent part of
                    their being, though it is subject to change via magic. Your race is an integral part of character
                    creation, and each race has different advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                <p>Some races, such as Dwarves and Halflings, have sub-races. You must choose one of these sub-races during
                    character creation. While all sub-races have the same basic characteristics of the overall race to
                    which they belong, they're often specialized in certain ways.</p>
                <p>As always, consult your DM to determine if a given race is a valid option for you to play in your
                    game. All races from supplemental materials are included here, some of which may not fit into your
                    campaign's setting.</p>

                            <p>Dragons have an association with a damage type or element as denoted by their color. In
                                addition, dragons can either be chromatic or metallic. Generally, metallic dragons are
                                Good while chromatic dragons are Evil. This isn't necessarily a factor during character
                                creation, but may be useful information for you.</p>

                                "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually
                                mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting
                                in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

                                it represents. Fire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame, which you can
                                use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your

                                volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
