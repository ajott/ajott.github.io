                    <p>Generally, a player will make a test with the main characteristic for a skill. However,
                        sometimes
                        the GM determines that an alternate characteristic would make more sense in a given
                        situation
                        - perhaps an attempt to use Deceive to craft a disguise would rely on a character's
                        Intelligence,
                        rather than their Fellowship. Should a test need to be made with an alternate
                        characteristic,
                        this must be determined before the roll.
