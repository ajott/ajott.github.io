                    <br />
                    <p>A critical roll is considered to be an unmodified 10 on a damage roll. If the roll is 1d10,
                        this
                        is pretty obvious. If the roll is 1d5, one must remember that a d5 in Dark Heresy is a d10,
                        counting
                        1-2 as
                        <b>1</b>, 3-4 as
                        <b>2</b>, etc. Therefore, it is just as likely to critically roll with a d5. </p>
                    <p>Should a character make a critical roll on an attack, and if the attack inflicts damage (is
                        not completely
                        negated by

                        </span>of the body part), the player then rolls 1d5 and finds the appropriate result on the
                        Critical
                        Effects tables (below) for their weapon's damage type.</p>
                    <p>Some considerations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Critical effects inflicted from Righteous Fury do not inflict Critical Damage</li>
                            <li>Unnamed "troop"-class enemies are considered to have been immediately slain by
