                    <p>
                        To practice Malefic Daemonology is to invite corruption. Each time a Psyker successfully
                        manifests a power from this discipline, he gains Corruption Points equal to the Psy Rating used.
                        <br />
                        Should the use of Maleific Daemonology be discovered, the Psyker risks being branded
                        Excommunicate Traitoris. <br />
                        To learn these foul powers, an Acolyte needs to gain the knowledge somehow. This may be from
                        reading a tome of forbidden lore, or by making a Dark Pact with a Daemon.
                    </p>
