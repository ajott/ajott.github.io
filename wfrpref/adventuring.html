                    <h4>Healing Wounds</h4>
                    <p>Without medical attention, you can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance Test</strong> after a good sleep once a day. You Heal Wounds equal to the <mono>SL + your Toughness Bonus</mono>. For each day you spend taking it easy, you also heal an extra number of Wounds equal to your Toughness Bonus. </p>
                    <p>If you wish to Heal more Wounds than this, then you need to be attended by someone with the <skill>Heal</skill> skill or you’ll need bandages, a healing poultice, or similar.</p>
                    <p>There is no penalty for being wounded. Lost Wounds are considered to be small cuts, bruises, and other easily ignored injuries.</p>
                    <h4>Healing Critical Wounds</h4>
                    <p>If you have received any Critical Wounds, you are said to be Critically Wounded. Critical Wounds can be very serious. Refer to the appropriate Critical Table to see exactly what penalties you suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained. Critical Wounds do not count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved. When you are Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the normal rules.</p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l6">
                    <h4>Medical Attention</h4>
                    <p>Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved until you receive medical attention. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Successful use of the <skill>Heal</skill> skill.</li>
                            <li>Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar.</li>
                            <li>Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Surgery</h5>
                    <p>Some wounds are beyond simple stitching and foul-smelling poultices. If you suffer a Critical Wound where surgery is required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer the marked penalties until you visit an appropriately trained doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine surgery equivalent.</p>
                    <p>Further, if you suffer an amputated body part, you cannot heal 1 of the suffered Wounds until a surgeon successfully treats it with a <skill>Heal</skill> Test. For more information on surgery, refer to the <talent>Surgery</talent> talent.</p>

                    <h4>Drowning & Suffocation</h4>
                    <p>If prepared, you can hold your breath for <mono>Toughness Bonus x 10</mono> seconds without a Test. After that, you may start to suffocate or drown. If you are unprepared and suddenly deprived of air, you will start to suffocate immediately.</p>
                    <p>Each Round you are being suffocated you lose 1 Wound. Should you reach 0 Wounds, you immediately receive the <condition>Unconscious</condition> Condition. After that, you will die of suffocation or drowning in Toughness Bonus Rounds.</p>
                    <h4>Exposure</h4>
                    <p>Every 4 hours spent in a difficult environment — such as sub-zero temperatures, a hot desert, or a howling storm — requires you take an Endurance Test. Extreme environments require a Test every 2 hours.</p>
                    <p><eh>Cold:</eh> Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 <strong>Ballistic Skill</strong>, <strong>Agility</strong> and <strong>Dexterity</strong>. The second failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10. Third and subsequent failures cause <mono>1d10</mono> Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost. If you reach zero Wounds, you immediately take an Unconscious condition. Certain Trappings provide bonuses and penalties to these Tests.</p>
                    <p><eh>Heat:</eh> Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 to <strong>Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Willpower</strong>, and adds a <condition>Fatigued</condition> Condition. The second failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10%, and adds another <condition>Fatigued</condition> Condition. Third and subsequent failures cause <mono>1d10</mono> Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost. Stripping off heavy Trappings cancels 1 failed test.</p>

                    <p>Running out of provisions can be bad. Running out of water is worse. Endurance Tests to withstand thirst and hunger become increasingly difficult (cumulative –10 for every test). Characters without food and water cannot heal Wounds or recover Fatigue naturally.</p>
                    <p><eh>Water:</eh> Every day without water requires you make an Endurance test. The first failed Test causes a penalty of –10 <strong>Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Willpower</strong>, and <strong>Fellowship</strong>. Second and subsequent failures reduce all Characteristics by –10 and cause <mono>1d10</mono> Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.</p>
                    <p><eh>Food:</eh> Every 2 days without food require an Endurance Test. The first failed Tests causes a penalty of –10 <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Toughness</strong>.

                    <h4>Setting Out</h4>
                    <p>To begin, the Characters must determine their destination or direction. With a destination in
                        mind, the GM can determine how long the journey will take, dividing the travel time into Stages.
                        During each Stage of a journey, the GM rolls for the Weather, the Characters may engage in
                        Travel Endeavours, and any Travel Events that take place are resolved. The Arrival Phase occurs
                        as the characters reach their destination — hopefully not too much worse for wear.</p>
                    <h4>Destination & Directions</h4>
                    <p>Before setting off on a journey, the Characters must determine where they are going or, at least,
                        what direction they are going in. If the Characters have a map of the location, they should have
                        a reasonable idea of where they're headed and how long it will take, though maps of the Empire
                        are notoriously inaccurate. Without a map, the Characters are reliant on directions from others
                        — perhaps making <skill>Gossip</skill> Tests whenever they stop in a coaching inn — and on the
                        even-more-unreliable road signs that dot the landscape.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l6">
                    <h4>Travel Stages</h4>
                    <p>A journey is divided into a number of Travel Stages. The number of Stages is up to GM discretion,
                        with longer journeys having more Stages. The GM should feel free to adjust the number of Stages
                        based on the Players’ preferences. For some groups, detailed journeys with a plethora of random
                        encounters and challenges can become an exciting, memorable part of their Character’s adventure.
                        For other groups, a brief description of the journey with one or two complications to add some
                        spice is more than enough.</p>
                    <p>Once the number of Stages is determined, it is modified by the lowest Movement among the
                        Characters, whether on foot, mounted, or in a vehicle. If this is 3 or less, the journey should
                        be increased by 1–2 stages. If the Characters are all lucky enough to possess mounts with a
                        Movement of 6 or more, the total number of Stages is halved to a minimum of 1.</p>
                    <p>Characters may attempt to reduce this number further with a <strong>Challenging (+0) <skill>
                                Navigation</skill> or a <skill>Lore</skill> Test</strong>. The Test must be relevant to
                        the location, such as <skill>Lore (Reikland)</skill>. Having a proper map of the route makes the
                        Test Average (+20). A success reduces the number of Stages by 1, to a minimum of 1.</p>

                            outdoors away from wine and warmth. Rain reduces visibility to 75 ft or less. Additionally,

                            hear and imposing a –10 penalty on all physical Tests. Everything and everyone not under
                            cover is soaked through within minutes. Water streams off the road, carving deep gullies so
                            that the road is churned to little more than a bog. Ranged weapons suffer a –20 penalty to
                            use due to the terrible weather, and exposed gunpowder is immediately ruined. Animals with
                            the <trait>Skittish</trait> Trait may also become spooked by sudden jolts of lightning
                            during bad storms.</p>
                        <h4>Snow</h4>
                        <p>A gentle snow covers the world in a blanket of white, making everything seem new and clean.
                            It is undoubtedly beautiful, until one has to move through it. Snow reduces visibility to
                            150 ft, and makes movement faster than Walking impossible. Characters travelling in Snow
                            must make an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance Test</strong> or gain a <condition>Fatigued
                            </condition> Condition.</p>
                        <h4>Blizzard</h4>
                        <p>Snow turns everything into a sightless white hell. The road disappears beneath a
                            fast-accumulating blanket of snow, leaving only trees to steer by. Visibility is close to
                            zero. Movement faster than Walking is impossible. Ranged weapons are useless in these
                            conditions. Characters travelling in a Blizzard must make a <strong>Challenging (+0)
                                Endurance Test</strong> or gain a <condition>Fatigued</condition> Condition.</p>

                        <p>Travel encounters come in three flavours: Positive, Coincidental, and Harmful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <eh>Positive Encounters</eh> are generally beneficial to your party, though many groups find
                            a way to turn any situation against them! Positive Encounters may be triggered by an
                            Impressive success or better on a Travel Endeavour, or simply if the GM wishes to reward the
                            Characters for being particularly clever or well prepared.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <eh>Coincidental Encounters</eh> are neither harmful nor beneficial to the Character, they
                            are simply the sort of thing travellers in the Old World run into as a matter of course.
                            These Encounters can be used if the Characters have rolled neither an Impressive success or
                            failure on a Travel Endeavour, or simply because the GM wishes to add some local colour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <eh>Harmful Encounters</eh> are unfortunately common; The Empire is fraught with danger, and
                            an unwary or simply unlucky traveller can fall afoul of any number of hazards. Should one of
                            the Characters fumble a Travel Endeavour, or the majority of characters fail in their Travel
                            Endeavours, any of these misadventures may befall them.

                <a href="./adventuring.html#events">Events Table</a>. Some Events may only affect the character making
                the roll, while others have broader implications for the party as a whole.
            </p>
            <h4>Endeavours</h4>
            <p>After the Events are determined, each character may undertake Endeavours. The number of Endeavours will
                vary depending on the length of the break; a maximum of one Endeavour may be undertaken for each week
                you are not adventuring, and <em>no more than three</em> Endeavours in total, regardless of how long the
                break is.</p>
            <p>While most of these Endeavours can be attempted by anyone, some are better suited to a particular Class

            <h4>Money to Burn</h4>
            <p>After you’ve rolled on the Event Table, you can spend the money earned during your last adventures using
                the normal rules. Then, after completing your Endeavours, all money held by your character is considered
                spent. All of it. The silver lifted from a Burgher’s purse? Gone. The booty liberated from pirates? Also
                gone. That Troll hoard you raided? Gone, too. All of it.</p>
            <p>What happened to it? It was spent, stolen, drunk, gambled, used for repairs, to pay off debts or taxes,
                given as a charitable donations or votive offerings, spent on bribes, or used in whatever other way you
                prefer. You should concoct the best story for what happens to those funds, as it explains a lot about
                your character.</p>
            <p>If you want to keep some of your hard-won coin to use in the future, you should undertake the <endeavour>
                    Banking</endeavour> Endeavour. If you want money at the beginning of the next adventure — honestly,
                or otherwise, depending on your Career — you should undertake the <endeavour>Income</endeavour>
                Endeavour.</p>
