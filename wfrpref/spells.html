                        <h3>Second Sight</h3>
                        <p>The <talent>Second Sight</talent> Talent (see page 144) allows you to perceive
                            the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around
                            you. Second Sight affects all your senses, and how it manifests
                            is dependent on individual experience and training: So, where
                            Aqshy may have a hot, cinnamon odour to one pyromancer, it
                            could feel like searing ear itches to another.</p>
                        <p>If you have Second Sight, you may use any appropriate Skills with
                            your aethyric senses, most commonly your <skill>Intuition</skill>, <skill>Perception</skill>,
                            and <skill>Track</skill> Skills. For example, a wizard following the trail of a
                            fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces
                            of <em>Dhar</em> in the witch’s path, rather than their literal footsteps. Or
                            a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally
                            could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely. Like the
                            mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which
                            is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have
                            no truck with the Winds of Magic but cannot help what they
                            perceive. This means the GM may request Tests, or take Tests
                            on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your
                            surrounding environment, even if you’re not looking for them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w3-col s12 m12 l5">
                        <h3>Spells</h3>
                        <p>There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos
                            spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts
                            of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying
                            any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you
                            can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the
                            Lore of Fire, you need the <talent>Arcane Magic (Fire)</talent> Talent. Chaos
                            spells are those practiced by those who’ve lost their souls to
                            Chaos.</p>
                        <h4>Memorising Spells</h4>
                        <p>Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick)
                            in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into
                            your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell.</p>
                        <p>To memorise a spell — and therefore be able to cast it without
                            access to your grimoire — you typically need to spend the amount
                            of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent (see Chapter 4: Skills
                            and Talents). Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster
                            knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.</p>

                        <h3>Repelling the Winds</h3>
                        <p>Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are
                            manipulating helps attract the magic to you. This is the reason
                            most wizards choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order.</p>
                        <p>All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a –1 SL penalty if you
                            are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying
                            to attract, as determined by the GM. Specifically, metal and
                            leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the
                            golden wind <em>Chamon</em>, while leather retains traces of the amber
                            <em>Ghur</em>. As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL penalty
                            to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point
                            on the location with the most armour. Casters with the <talent>Arcane
                                Magic (Metal)</talent> Talent may wear metal armour without penalty;
                            those with <talent>Arcane Magic (Beasts)</talent> Talent may ignore penalties
                            from leather armour.

                        <h3>Dispelling</h3>
                        <p>If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards,
                            you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you
                            chant a counterspell. Make an <b>Opposed Language (Magick) Test</b>.
                            If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if
                            you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine
                            whether the casting was successful as normal. You may only
                            attempt to dispel a single spell every Round.</p>
                        <h4>Dispelling Persistent Spells</h4>
                        <p>If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell
                            for your Action. This is done by making an <b>Extended Language
                                (Magick) Test</b>. When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing
                            spell, you successfully dispel it.</p>
                        <p>Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll
                            separately. If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to
                            make an Assisted Test instead.</p>

                            <p>To cast a spell, make a <b>Language (Magick) Test</b>. If you succeed,
                                match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in
                                the individual spell description). If your SL is equal to or higher than
                                the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell’s description.
                                If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens.</p>

                                <h4>Talents</h4>
                                <p>Reminder: talents which affect a test &mdash; in this case, <talent>Instinctive
                                        Diction</talent> and <talent>Perfect Pitch</talent> &mdash; automatically add +1 SL per rank

                            <h4>Critical Casting</h4>
                            <p>If the casting roll is a Critical (see page 159), the Winds of Magic
                                have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at
                                a cost. Unless you have the <talent>Instinctive Diction</talent> Talent, you roll
                                on the <a href="./spells.html#minorMiscast">Minor Miscast Table</a> as the power moves
                                beyond your
                                control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Critical Cast:</b> If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a
                                    Critical Wound. See page 172 for details.</li>
                                <li><b>Total Power:</b> The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your
                                    rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.</li>
                                <li><b>Unstoppable Force:</b> If you scored enough SL to cast your
                                    spell, it cannot be Dispelled.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                            <h4>Fumbled Casting</h4>
                            <p>If you lose control of the magical energy you are channelling,
                                things invariably go awry. If you Fumble your Casting Test, you
                                suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the <a href="./spells.html#minorMiscast">Minor
                                    Miscast Table</a> Table.</p>

                            <h4>Magic Missiles</h4>
                            <p>Some spells are marked as <em>magic missiles</em>; these are damage-causing
                                spells that all follow the same rules. When a <em>magic
                                    missile</em> is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit
                                Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on
                                the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location
                                Table (see page 159). The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is
                                added to the spell’s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to
                                determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by
                                the target’s Toughness and Armour Points as normal.</p>
                            <h4>Touch Spells in Combat</h4>
                            <p>Certain spells require you to touch the target. If in combat,
                                or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an
                                <b>Opposed Melee (Brawling) Test</b> (generally opposed by the
                                Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test.
                                If you do this and your spell was a magic missile, the Melee
                                (Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not
                                the Language (Magick) Test.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                            <p>Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate
                                ingredient before unleashing their spells. Doing this offers
                                protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the
                                worst of any magical backlash.</p>
                            <p>If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major
                                Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast
                                has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or
                                destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.</p>
                            <p>Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore
                                spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your
                                character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for
                                specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking
                                to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each
                                of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual
                                spell lists.</p>


                            <h4>Limitations</h4>
                            <p>As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak — not gagged,
                                strangled, or underwater — to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the
                                Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should
                                be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs
                                to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly,
                                and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but
                                subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder
                                the spell is chanted.</p>
                            <p>Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have
                                to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before
                                using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or
                                penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty
                                is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell
                                providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10
                                Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30.</p>
                            <p>Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to
                                see — i.e. have Line of Sight — to your target.</p>
                            <h4>Duration</h4>
                            <p>If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration
                                unless it is dispelled. You may not simply end your spells already
                                in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them.</p>
                            <h4>Grimoires</h4>
                            <p>Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they
                                transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master,
                                while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from
                                other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may
                                cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore
                                they possess. Doing so doubles the Casting Number.</p>

                            <div class="w3-round-large w3-panel w3-light-blue w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-blue">
                                <p>
                                    If you start play with a Grimoire, it is up to the GM to
                                    determine how many spells your master has recorded within
                                    it. Some Masters are more generous than others, but <b>most
                                        provide at least four new spells to study, and few provide
                                        more than eight</b>. If you have a spell Memorised, you do not
                                    need access to your Grimoire to cast it. If you have not yet
                                    memorised a spell, you may use your Grimoire to cast it
                                    using both your hands. This doubles the CN of the spell and
                                    exposes your Grimoire to possible damage or theft.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Overcasting</h4>
                            <p>For every +2 SL you achieve in a Casting Test, you may add
                                additional Range, Area of Effect, Duration, or Targets equal to
                                the initial value listed in the spell. Spells with a Range and Target
                                of ‘You’ may only ever target the spellcaster making the Casting
                                Test. Spells with a Range of ‘Touch’ may not be extended. If the
                                Spell has no Duration, you cannot extend it.</p>
                            <p>You may choose the same option more than once. For instance, if
                                you achieved + 4 SL above your Casting Number on a spell with
                                a Target of 1, you may now Target 3 individuals. Certain Spells
                                may have additional, optional benefits for additional SL noted in
                                their description.</p>

                            <h4>Channeling a Spell</h4>
                            <p>Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally
                                be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such
                                spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate
                                them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill.
                                Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure,
                                but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel
                                magic for a spell, make an <b>Extended Channelling Test</b>.</p>
                            <p>When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have
                                channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can
                                cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the
                                chosen spell’s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you
                                also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor
                                Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.
                            </p>

                                <h4>Talents</h4>

                                        Diction</talent> and <talent>Perfect Pitch</talent> &mdash; automatically add +1 SL per rank

                            <h4>Critical Channeling</h4>
                            <p>If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled
                                a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round
                                regardless of the SL you’ve scored in the Extended Test so far;
                                however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place
                                results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the <a
                                    href="./spells.html#minorMiscast">Minor
                                    Miscast Table</a> unless you have the <talent>Aethyric Attunement</talent> Talent

                            <h4>Fumble</h4>
                            <p>
                                Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous.
                                You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a
                                Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling
                                Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the <a

                            <h4>Interruptions</h4>
                            <p>Concentration is vital when channelling. If you are distracted
                                by anything — loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights,
                                or similar — you must pass a <b>Hard (–20) Cool Test</b>, or suffer a
                                Minor Miscast and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended
                                Channelling Test so far.
                            </p>
                            <div class="w3-round-large w3-panel w3-light-blue w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-blue">
                                <h4>Option: Risky Channeling</h4>
                                <p>As written, channeling a spell with a high CN can take several rounds, and the spell can only be cast the round after the cumulative SL of the <b>Extended Channeling Test</b> has met or exceeded the CN of the spell.</p>
                                <p>An optional variant is to allow for a <b>Casting &ndash; Language (Magic) &ndash; Test </b> in place of the Channeling test, with the CN of the spell reduced by the cumulative SL on the <b>Extended Channeling Test</b>.</p>
                                <p>Taking this option and casting without reducing the CN of the spell to 0 automatically prompts a roll on the <a href="./spells.html#minorMiscast">Minor Miscast Table</a>.</p>
                                <p>If this <b>Casting Test</b> fails, immediately roll on the <a href="./spells.html#majorMiscast">Major Miscast Table</a> as the Winds scour your body; if the spell was cast with ingredients, roll a <a href="./spells.html#minorMiscast">Minor Miscast</a> instead. Fumbling a risky cast like this always causes a Major Miscast, regardless of whether an ingredient was used or not.</p>
